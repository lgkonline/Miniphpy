# MINIPHPY

## Okay, what is Miniphpy?

Miniphpy is a small tool for web developers to minify JavaScript and CSS files
for their projects.

How you could guess, Miniphpy is a PHP app which runs on your PC.


## Combine your JS files

There are already tools like Koala which let you compile LESS/Sass and also minify CSS and JS files.
But I couldn' find a good way to combine JS files.

And that's why I started Miniphpy.
